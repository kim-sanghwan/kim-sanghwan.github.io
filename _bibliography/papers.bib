  abstract={In contrast to the natural capabilities of humans to learn new tasks in a sequential fashion, neural networks are known to suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where the model's performances on old tasks drop dramatically after being optimized for a new task. Since then, the continual learning (CL) community has proposed several solutions aiming to equip the neural network with the ability to learn the current task (plasticity) while still achieving high accuracy on the previous tasks (stability). Despite remarkable improvements, the plasticity-stability trade-off is still far from being solved and its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In this work, we propose Auxiliary Network Continual Learning (ANCL), a novel method that applies an additional auxiliary network which promotes plasticity to the continually learned model which mainly focuses on stability. More concretely, the proposed framework materializes in a regularizer that naturally interpolates between plasticity and stability, surpassing strong baselines on task incremental and class incremental scenarios. Through extensive analyses on ANCL solutions, we identify some essential principles beneath the stability-plasticity trade-off.},

  abstract={Learning two tasks in a single shared function has some benefits. Firstly by acquiring information from the second task, the shared function leverages useful information that could have been neglected or underestimated in the first task. Secondly, it helps to generalize the function that can be learned using generally applicable information for both tasks. To fully enjoy these benefits, Multi-task Learning (MTL) has long been researched in various domains such as computer vision, language understanding, and speech synthesis. While MTL benefits from the positive transfer of information from multiple tasks, in a real environment, tasks inevitably have a conflict between them during the learning phase, called negative transfer. The negative transfer hampers function from achieving the optimality and degrades the performance. To solve the problem of the task conflict, previous works only suggested partial solutions that are not fundamental, but ad-hoc. A common approach is using a weighted sum of losses. The weights are adjusted to induce positive transfer. Paradoxically, this kind of solution acknowledges the problem of negative transfer and cannot remove it unless the weight of the task is set to zero. Therefore, these previous methods had limited success. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that can drive positive transfer and suppress negative transfer by leveraging class-wise weights in the learning process. The weights act as an arbitrator of the fundamental unit of information to determine its positive or negative status to the main task.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
