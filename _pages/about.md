I am a master student at ETH Zürich majoring in Data Science. Currently, I am working on LLM guided video understanding at [Computer Vision lab](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/), ETH Zürich. My research interests lie in the broad topics of computer vision and its applications in healthcare. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) in 2020.
