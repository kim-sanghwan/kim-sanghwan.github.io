I'm a dedicated Data Science enthusiast currently pursuing my Master's degree at ETH Zürich. My journey in the world has taken me across Switzerland and South Korea, where I've accumulated a wealth of experience in machine learning and computer vision.

My research passion revolves around the broad topics of computer vision and its applications in healthcare, a field known as ML4H (Machine Learning for Healthcare). My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/), graduating in 2020.

Currently, I am working on video understanding guided by large language model and vision language model at [AIT lab](https://ait.ethz.ch/), ETH Zürich. My recent contributions have been recognized through full paper publications, where I've tackled diverse challenges. These include (1) accelerating the sampling process of diffusion models through simple ODE solver distillation, (2) enhancing radiology report generation models by crafting rule-based labelers, and (3) introducing a novel approach to continual learning, achieving a better balance between stability and plasticity.
