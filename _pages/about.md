I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree at ETH Zürich. My academic career has taken me across Switzerland and South Korea, where I've accumulated a wealth of experience in machine learning and artificial intelligence. In 2020, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/).

My research interest revolves around the broad topics of machine perception, especially at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. 

Currently, I am working on video understanding guided by large language model and vision language model at [AIT lab](https://ait.ethz.ch/), ETH Zürich. My recent contributions have been recognized through full paper publications, where I've tackled diverse challenges. These include (1) accelerating the sampling process of diffusion models through simple ODE solver distillation, (2) enhancing radiology report generation models by crafting rule-based labelers, and (3) introducing a novel approach to continual learning, achieving a better balance between stability and plasticity.
